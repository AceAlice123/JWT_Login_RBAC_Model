After installing the dependencies 
Set Environment Variables in .env
in folder directory Run "npm run ServerOn" Same lettercase as it .
Check and test through the frontend 
Otherwise Use PostMan like Services to make calls to different routes
(Note to keep the frontend seemless we are using a jwt cookie and so jwt token will not be authorised using json format)
